# Money Shuffle

## Description

The Money Shuffle app is created for users who would like to keep track of the money they spend. It offers insight into how much budget is used for specific categories of expenses. The aim is to offer a straightforward and practical solution that is easy to use. To increase ease of use, the app uses rounded numbers (no decimals).

One of the definitions of *shuffle* is to rearrange, to move from one place to another. The idea behind the app is that users set a budget for specific expenses, and keep track of their expenditures. The users are presented with an overview of expenditures versus budget at the end of the day or week. This makes it easy for users to rearrange the budget in case of unexpected expenses or changes in priorities. It also helps users to be more aware of where the money is going.
