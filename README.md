# Money Shuffle
## *work in progress*


<br>


## Description

The Money Shuffle app is created for users who would like to keep track of the money they spend. It offers insight into how much budget is used for specific categories of expenses. The aim is to offer a straightforward and practical solution that is easy to use. To increase ease of use, the app uses rounded numbers (no decimals).

One of the definitions of *shuffle* is to rearrange, to move from one place to another. The idea behind the app is that users set a budget for specific expenses, and keep track of their expenditures. The users are presented with an overview of expenditures versus budget at the end of the day or week. This makes it easy for users to rearrange the budget in case of unexpected expenses or changes in priorities. It also helps users to be more aware of where the money is going.

The central component of the app is the overview page with the current budgets. Some standard expenditure categories are provided as a starting point (these can be changed or deleted). The user can:

-  create categories of expenses, or change/delete an existing category
-  keep an overview of the total amount of expenditure for each category
-  generate a weekly or monthly overview of expenditure per category
-  set alerts in case a certain percentage of a budget is reached

The homepage has the categories of expenses and the user can click and go to the page of a category. On the category page, the user can:

-  set a budget for the current category of expenses
-  check the budget and add, edit and delete expenses
